            <p>I'd like to introduce myself. Hi, I'm Karah Cereza. You can call me whatever you like because I don't have a moniker. I was a resident of Fairview. I am the youngest of six members of the family. My parents are incredibly hardworking, and I'm grateful that they are my parents. For this reason, I do my hardest at everything I do, especially in school, so they'll be pleased of me and feel like their hard work isn't being wasted. I can sing and dance, but I'm not as good as the otherperformer. I thought I was good for something, but I haven't discovered it yet. My interests include reading comic books and Wattpad, playing video games online, and watching movies and television shows. My hobbies truly bring me joy, especially when I'm doing them with someone. They also help me relax and feel as like I'm in an other universe.
            </p>
